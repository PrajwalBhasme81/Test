1.Explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java. Provide example for each.
ANS:-Checked Exception--
     *Checked exceptions are the Compiled time exception.
     *Checked at compile time.
     *These are Handled by try & catch or throws.
     *Ex:-IOException
	  SQLException
	  FileNotFoundException
     Unchecked Exception--
     *Unchecked Exception are the Run time exception.
     *Not checked at compile time.
     *These are no need to handle.
     *Ex:-ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
	  ArithmeticException
	  NullPointerException

2.Describe the try-catch block in Java.How does the finally block differ from catch? Can a try block exist without a catch? Explain with an example.
ANS:-try-catch:
     *The try-catch block is used to handle exception.
     *Syntax:
	try{
	
	}
	catch(){

	}
     finally:
     *The finally block is an optional block. 
     *It is used to execute code that must and should run whether an exception was thrown or not. 
     
     *Yes the try block will exist without catch but the finally is bond with the try.

4.Define Polymorphism and its types. Give an example for each.
ANS:-Polymorphism is a one of the Object oriented programming concept. Polymorphism is a Greek word poly means Many and morph means Forms, that is polymorphism means one having many forms.
*There are 2 types 
1.Compile-Time polymorphism
2.Run-Time polymorphism

5.What is abstraction in Java. Explain how abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
ANS:-Abstraction is a one of the Object oriented programming concept. Abstraction means hiding the implementation and only showing the essential features of Objects.
